SQL-Speak is a terminal-native utility that bridges the gap between natural language and structured data. It leverages the GitHub Copilot CLI as an intelligent translation layer, allowing developers to query local databases (like SQLite) using plain English. Instead of context-switching to a heavy GUI or manually writing complex JOINs for a quick data check, you can simply "speak" to your database directly from the command line.
